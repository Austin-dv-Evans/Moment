# Moment

Hello World and thank you for checking out my application Moment.

Moment gives the user three ways to access their video camera and start recording faster than ever
before.

When the user first opens the application they will have to grant permission to the video camera and
microphone.

Once those permissions are granted they are brought to the set up page. There they click a button
titled Register Voice, they say the words "Moment Record".

If successful they will receive a Toast saying "Moment is Ready" and they will have a new
notification and Moment will start operating in the foreground.

Within the notification the user can click it and be brought back to the app or they can expand the
notification and find a button to directly access their video camera.

There two Moment icons on the set up page and the record video page they are toggles to turn on and
off the notification / foreground service if desired.

The user also has access to the video camera directly in the record video activity.

Finally any "Moments" that are recorded from these buttons have instant playback, allowing the user
to say "ok" or "retry", if "ok" the "Moment" is saved to the "myMoments" gallery. Where the user
can view all their most recently recorded "Moments"

Moment is currently working on integration with the Google assistant. Upon completion, users will
be able to say "Hey Google, Moment Record" and they will be instantly recording video even if their
screen is locked or the application's foreground service hasn't been started. The user will also be
able to say "Hey Google, Open Moment". Eventually we plan to integrate with Google Slices so the
user will be able to say "Hey Google, show me my last moment".
